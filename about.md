I am an entrepreneur, cloud and network operator, and developer based in
Dallas, TX.

My current focus is on [Openstack](https://openstack.org) and [Ceph](https://ceph.com) based HA clouds, particularly scalable public cloud architecture and stateless/diskless hypervisors. I deploy with [OpenStack-Ansible](https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible) and [contribute](https://review.openstack.org/#/q/owner:logan2211%2540gmail.com) regularly to that project. I also author or contribute to a variety of other Ansible roles and projects.

A 10-year veteran of the hosting industry, I co-founded [Limestone Networks](https://www.lstn.net) and consult with hosting providers on cloud strategies. I also continue to maintain [AS46475](http://bgp.he.net/AS46475)'s Internet backbone.

Feel free to contact me by [email](mailto:logan@protiumit.com) or on [Freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net) (logan-) if I can be of any assistance!
